## 🎮 Game Concept
**Sync Dash** is a fast-paced **endless runner** where the player must navigate obstacles while a **ghost player** mimics their movements with a slight delay. The goal is to survive as long as possible while avoiding obstacles and collecting orbs.

- **Tap the screen or press `Space` to Jump.**  
- **Ghost System:** A delayed shadow of the player copies their actions.  
- **Obstacles & Orbs:** Avoid obstacles and collect orbs to increase your score.  
- **Speed Increases Over Time:** The game gets harder as you play.  

## 🎨 Features
